for closing listen port in ubuntu you can use below command

sudo kill $(sudo lsof -t -i:3000)
in place of 3000 you can specify your port number

lsof command will give information about file opened by process

-t : This flag specifies that lsof should produce terse output with process identifiers only and no header - e.g., so that the output may be piped to kill(1). This option selects the -w option.

-i : This flag selects the listing of files any of whose Internet address matches the address specified in i. If no address is specified, this option selects the listing of all Internet and x.25 (HP-UX) network files.
